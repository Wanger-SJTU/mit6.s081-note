# part 1
- Which registers contain arguments to functions? For example, which register holds 13 in main's call to printf?
- Where is the call to function f in the assembly code for main? Where is the call to g? (Hint: the compiler may inline functions.)

- At what address is the function printf located?
What value is in the register ra just after the jalr to printf in main?


- In the following code, what is going to be printed after 'y='? (note: the answer is not a specific value.) Why does this happen?

	printf("x=%d y=%d", 3);
